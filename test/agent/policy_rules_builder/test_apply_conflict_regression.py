"""Regression guard: the live ``/apply`` conflict path is UNCHANGED by the conflict-check diagnostic.

This test is **deterministic** (NOT marked ``integration`` / ``llm``) so it runs in the default
suite and under ``-m "not integration"``. Feature #154's design rests on D1/D8 -- the read-only
diagnostic is a *separate* assembly and the safety-critical live ``/apply`` graph stays
byte-for-byte unchanged, still **raising** ``PolicyContradictionError`` -> HTTP 422 on a genuine
grant/deny contradiction (the diagnostic *records* instead). This guard pins both ends of that live
contract; it stays valid after ``/policy/check`` was retired (#2500) and the diagnostic engine was
re-homed as an internal library — the live ``/apply`` raise path is unaffected by that move:

  1. **Builder level** -- with ``graph._structured_call`` patched so the auditor returns a genuine
     ``Contradiction``, ``build_role_rules`` RAISES ``PolicyContradictionError`` and returns no rule
     set (fail-closed). Mirrors ``test_graph.py``'s genuine-overlap slice.
  2. **Route level** -- ``POST /apply/service/{id}`` maps that ``PolicyContradictionError`` to HTTP
     422 and never reaches the PCE. ``onboard_service`` is patched to raise (so no cluster / LLM is
     needed), mirroring how ``test/agent/controller/test_routes.py`` drives ``/apply``.
